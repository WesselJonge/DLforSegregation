This is the start of the repository for my thesis covering deep learning for measuring segregation. The script used for taking the measurements is found under Full image analysis. This is the only script that fully covers all data extractions and visiualizations. The scripts under image analysis for performance purpose soley perform the material recognizion and make the figures with the colours representing the particles.
In the last category Training scripts, the scripts used to setup the training environment are located. Eacht of the files could be found in the map of the model or by using the links below.
The dataset used is uploaded as well, while all the models download it themself while running.
*All scripts are written for an online environment (Colab). Therefore, they install everything at the begining of the script. When using a different environment, the installation may differ*
